          Mike Rodriguez is an former Marine who became a Windows XP administrator in the service,
          and he&apos;s stayed with it. He wanted to be a tank crewman, but unfortunately his
          partial color blindness limited the jobs he could perform inside a tank, so he had to take
          a different career path, and now here he is! There are all kinds of ways people come to
          computers. Mike was deployed to Iraq in 2005. Now he works for Teradata as an Application
          Security Analyst.
