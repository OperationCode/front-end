      question: 'When was Operation Code founded?',
      answer: (
        <>
          The first line of code for the Operation Code site was pushed on August 21, 2014.
          Operation Code formally became a 501(c)3 nonprofit on May 4, 2016.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'How was Operation Code founded?',
      answer: (
        <>
          Operation Code was founded in Portland, Oregon by ex-Army Captain David Molina, who took
          action and built operationcode.org to petition Congress to expand the New GI Bill to
          include code schools.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Operation Code a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization?',
      answer: (
        <>
          Yes. Operation Code was granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service,
          functioning as a charity under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, effective 4 May
          2016, with retroactive status to 15 June 2015. Donations to the organization are
          deductible as charitable contributions.

    {
      question: 'Where is Operation Code based? Do you have a location near me?',
      answer: (
        <>
          Operation Code, much like software, is built from anywhere with an internet connection,
          and is not based in one location. While we&apos;re headquartered in Portland, the entire
          organization is decentralized, including the board of directors and the core team. This
          allows us to more effectively serve the entire military community, whether they&apos;re
          veterans or military spouses, whether they&apos;re OCONUS or in-country. We have chapters
          all over the nation. Use Slack chat and join the closest town to you!

      ),

    {
      question: 'Who does Operation Code serve?',
      answer: (
        <>
          Operation Code serves our nation&apos;s finest who&apos;ve worn the uniform and their
          families who are interested in coding and software development. Our programs are offered
          at no cost to the military community, including veterans, transitioning service members,
          and military spouses and families.

      question:
        'What do I need to start learning software development and how much is this going to cost?',
      answer: (
        <>
          First off, you will need access to a solid computer, a good browser (ex. Chrome), and a
          strong internet connection. It costs nothing to start learning to code and receive
          software mentorship through Operation Code, you just need a positive attitude, persistence
          and grit, and a thirst for new knowledge. We have over a dozen channels, from Ruby to
          JavaScript, iOS to Android, and from Free Code Camp to edX study groups.
