# Maintainers

This file lists how the Operation Code Front End project is maintained. When making changes to the system, this file tells you who needs to review your contribution - you need a simple majority of maintainers for the relevant subsystems to provide a üëç on your pull request. Additionally, you need to not receive a veto from a Sergeant or the Project Lead.
