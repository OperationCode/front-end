- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Steps To Add

- Create the translated file in it's appropriate folder.
- Suffix the file name with your [2-letter language code](https://www.sitepoint.com/iso-2-letter-language-codes/). (CODE_OF_CONDUCT_ES.md for spanish)
- Link to that file at the top of the original file.

Example, inside [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md):

```
[German](./internationalized-documentation/Germany/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_DE.md)
```
