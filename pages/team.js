    description: `Kelly MacLeod is a veteran of the North Carolina Army National Guard, with a tour in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a self-taught coder, she is also a veteran and survivor of a career change. Helping veterans has always been a career goal; Kelly now advocates for veterans and milspouses who want to transition to a tech-related career. Her current position as a software project manager has absolutely nothing to do with this, but she leverages it to talk about vets every chance she gets. Kelly has yet to break the Operation Code website.`,

    description: `Ali Taylor-Cipolla is a compliance specialist by day, activist by night who works with Microsoft and Operation Code, respectively. After spending more than 8 years in the restaurant management field, where it was relatively easy to find work as a constantly moving military spouse, Ali understands the challenges faced by military families, having faced them firsthand. After her partner’s retirement from the United States Air Force, she moved to the Seattle area and completed Microsoft’s Military Spouse Technology Academy. This was where she discovered that she did not want to develop software for a living. However, her love for the technology sector and the people in it brought her to her present role with Global Talent Acquisition at Microsoft. Ali aspires to empower, connect and engage with military families and veterans, helping them achieve stability and realization of their professional goals. She is a current member of the Washington State Military Transition Council where she advocates for the interests of military spouses in her new home state. She lives with her partner and two pet pythons, and when she’s not professionally finding solutions to large problems, she enjoys gardening, PC gaming, and her circus arts practice.`,
