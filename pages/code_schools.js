              <p>
                Massive, Open, Online Courses (or MOOCs) are course study programs made available
                over the internet! Typically there are start and end dates, but the work itself is
                done at your own pace. MOOCs are usually free, but there are certain benefits to
                paying for premium aspects of MOOCs.
