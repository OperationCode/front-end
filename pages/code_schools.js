            Code schools are accelerated learning programs that will prepare you for a career in
            software development. Each school listed below ranges in length, vary in tuition costs,
            and in programming languages. Desirable from an employer&apos;s standpoint, code schools
            are founded by software developers who saw a need for more programmers and aspired to
            teach the next generation. We encourage you to check out the schools below, do your
            research, and ask fellow techies in our Slack Community.
