              <p>
                Code schools are accelerated learning programs that will prepare you for a career in
                software development. Each school listed below ranges in length, vary in tuition
                costs, and in programming languages. Desirable from an employer&apos;s standpoint,
                code schools are founded by software developers who saw a need for more programmers
                and aspired to teach the next generation. We encourage you to check out the schools
                below, do your research, and ask fellow techies in our Slack Community.

              <p>
                Massive, Open, Online Courses (or MOOCs) are course study programs made available
                over the internet! Typically there are start and end dates, but the work itself is
                done at your own pace. MOOCs are usually free, but there are certain benefits to
                paying for premium aspects of MOOCs.

                This innovative new pilot program pairs eligible Veterans with market-leading
                Training Providers offering the high-tech training and skills development sought by
                employers. You will have your classes and training paid for by VA and will receive a

                program, you&apos;ll train in one of the five areas (computer software, information
                science, computer programming, media application, or data processing) of high-tech
                training.
