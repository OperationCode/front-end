              In conjunction with Fresh Start Refugee Assistance Center, an Afghan-American led
              non-profit, and Globally.org’s ReUp Refugee Tech Re-Skilling Program, Operation Code
              is pleased to announce that we are continuing our Project Rebuild Refugee Tech
              Training Program. Since March 2022, Operation Code launched the initial pilot cohort,
              with 8 Afghan refugee participants in attendance.

            <p>
              <span className={styles.bold}>Fresh Start provides wraparound services</span> such as:
              initial refugee resettlement efforts, ESL classes, driver’s education and licensing,
              affordable housing, mental health and cultural transition support as well as job
              search assistance.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className={styles.bold}>
                Operation Code provides hands-on tech training and ongoing mentorship,
                apprenticeships and hiring
              </span>{' '}
              by providing our refugee participants a scholarship to complete one certification
              during the six-month cohort. Pairing a refugee with a Veteran or military spouse
              mentor to meet on a regular cadence, our two communities can continue to “rebuild” our
              parallel experiences, provide a tech-focused workforce development program and help
              refugees obtain high paid and meaningful work.

              also helps to accelerate and simplify the job hiring process for newly arrived Afghans
              in the United States, providing candidates with a path to access opportunities
              commensurate with their prior work experience and education.

                Help us reach our fundraising target of $36,000 USD to support 4 FALL cohort members
                who have been selected to participate in the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy

              Your generosity provides $9K in stipends per member to cover a total of 4.5 months of
              expenses while they are participating in the full-time program. The stipend will help
              to cover rent, utilities, food, and bills. Upon completion of the MSSA program,
              graduates earn on average nationwide, a salary of $70,000. This is more than 3 times
              the average annual income of a refugee household in the first 5 years of resettling in
              the USA.
