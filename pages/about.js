            We at Operation Code strive to provide an efficient way into a tech career for veterans
            and their families. We work directly with Senators, Congressmen, and Congresswomen to
            allow veterans total control of their future by permitting the use of the GI Bill on
            coding bootcamps. We also have a page where you can read about our{' '}

          <p className={styles.justifyAlign}>
            Aside from our work on the Hill, we offer many services to the military community and
            are continuing to expand our offerings as often as possible. First and foremost, our
            staff works tirelessly to provide mentorship for veterans interested in learning about
            various tech careers. Dozens of software engineers, product managers, system architects,
            security engineers, and various other IT professionals act as 1 - on - 1 mentors to all
            of our members. We also have a hardware loan program to help veterans in need of a
            laptop!
