        Operation Code is a non-profit charity helping the military community learn software
        development, enter the tech industry, and code the future.
      </h6>
      <p>
        We at Operation Code strive to provide an efficient way into a tech career for veterans and
        their families. We work directly with Senators, Congressmen, and Congresswomen to allow
        veterans total control of their future by permitting the use of the GI Bill on coding
        bootcamps. You can read about our organization&apos;s history{' '}

        Aside from our work on the Hill, we offer many services to the military community and are
        continuing to expand our offerings as often as possible. First and foremost, our staff works
        tirelessly to provide mentorship for veterans interested in learning about various tech
        careers. Dozens of software engineers, product managers, system architects, security
        engineers, and various other IT professionals act as 1 - on - 1 mentors to all of our
        members. We also have a hardware loan program to help veterans in need of a laptop!
