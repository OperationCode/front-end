              In conjunction with Fresh Start Refugee Assistance Center, an Afghan-American led
              non-profit, and Globally.org’s ReUp Refugee Tech Re-Skilling Program, Operation Code
              is pleased to announce that we are expanding our Project Rebuild Refugee Tech Training
              Program. Since March 2022, Operation Code launched the initial pilot cohort, with 8
              Afghan refugee participants in attendance. We have expanded the cohorts to include
              Ukrainian refugees and Ukrainian transitioning military service members and their
              spouses.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className={styles.bold}>Fresh Start provides wraparound services</span> such as:
              initial refugee resettlement efforts, ESL classes, driver’s education and licensing,
              affordable housing, mental health and cultural transition support as well as job
              search assistance.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className={styles.bold}>
                Operation Code provides hands-on tech training and ongoing mentorship,
                apprenticeships and hiring
              </span>{' '}
              by providing our refugee participants a scholarship to complete one certification
              during the six-month cohort. Pairing a refugee with a Veteran or military spouse
              mentor to meet on a regular cadence, our two communities can continue to “rebuild” our
              parallel experiences, provide a tech-focused workforce development program and help
              refugees obtain high paid and meaningful work.

              also helps to accelerate and simplify the job hiring process for newly arrived Afghans
              in the United States, providing candidates with a path to access opportunities
              commensurate with their prior work experience and education.
